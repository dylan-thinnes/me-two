    <b class="text">Who are you?</b><br/>
    <small>Hello, my name is Dylan! I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh, welcome to my website. I'm very passionate about technology's capacity to connect and to inform people, and have some fairly strong opinions on its use right now. It's no surprise then that I do a good deal of front-end, though I'm not at all averse to stricter back-end work.</small>

    <b class="text">About the Site</b><br/>
    <small>I wanted to make a site that prioritizes having a very small footprint, yet still looks nice and behaves like a single page app, and can gracefully drop back if JavaScript is disabled. I think I succeeded in that respect, disable JavaScript to see for yourself how the site copes.<br/>To see the source code, go to <a href="https://github.com/dylan-thinnes/me-two">Github</a>.</small>
