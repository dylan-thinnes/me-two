        Hello, my name is Dylan! I'm currently studying Computer Science at the
        University of Edinburgh, welcome to my website. I'm very passionate
        about technology's capacity to connect and to inform people. It's no
        surprise then that I do a good deal of front-end, though I'm not at all
        averse to stricter back-end work.

    <b class="text">About the Site</b><br/>
    <small>
        I wanted to make a site that prioritizes having a very small footprint,
        yet still looks nice and behaves like a single page app, and can
        gracefully drop back if JavaScript is disabled. I think I succeeded in
        that respect.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        - When Javascript is disabled, links to different endpoints call upon
        Rails to render all markup server-side. Disable JavaScript to see for
        yourself how the site copes just fine.
        <br/>
        - Aside from content and profile picture, the server sends only 4
        kilobytes over the network after assets are minified and compressed.
        <br/>
        - When Javascript is enabled, it takes over regular link behaviour and
        uses XHR and the History API instead, loading only the content you need.
